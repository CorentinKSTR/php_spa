Hello 

How my SPA site works : 


First, create an account on the "login" page or log in with an existing account, 

for example: 

(admin account): admin@pierre.com (password "1234") or 

(user account): corentin@kstr.com (password "1234")

when you have an account, go to the user page and log in

if you are not admin, you can add animals and delete them.

to do this, enter a name and select the type of animal in the select

If you are admin you can see the list of all users as well as the animals of each, for this you must go to the admin page (visible only by the admin user)

(no need to refresh locally to see some buttons appear but online need)
